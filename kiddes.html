            <p>It always a thing of joy when you see your toddler start to walk, the joy that come with the fisrt step is practically amazing, the teaching of the first steps start with the patrents,the smile are uncomprehensible.

                on the very day of her first birthday,our daughter rosie took her first steps. All around my sister's home,there were gasps and claps,laughter and smiles. <br><br>
            In the month since, i've watched her learn to walk- a rite of passage from babyhood to toddlerdom. Thode small first steps  left behinde tiny footprints in our home and indents forever on my heart <br><br>
        At First, she staggered and wobbled around like a late-night drunk, but with each passing day, she walks with grearter confidence and increasing speed. Each steps brings joy, and she constantly displays an incesant wounder on her face as to what she'll discover at the end of her horizon [currently, the length of our hallway]. </p>

            <p>If you think about how your child plays, you'll know that it's not always the same. on any other day, they can play in many different ways.That difference is even more extreme if you compare their play from month to month or year to year. </p>
